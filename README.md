# Description
I added accessibility code in HTML and CSS to the Challenge 1 "Horiseon" website. I added semantic class attributes for non-semantic elements, wrote alt text for images, and corrected header styling errors. I increased font-size to aid reading accessibility as well.

Here is a link to the deployed page: https://smokhadar.github.io/challenge-1/

Here is a screenshot of the webpage:

I worked off the following user story and acceptance criteria:

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

This exercise reinforced the knowledge I learned from the first week. I am eager to incorporate instructor feedback into this product and new projects moving forward.
